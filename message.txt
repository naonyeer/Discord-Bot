Bruh, I’m just vibin’
Lowkey tired af
Ain’t doin’ nothin’ rn
This day movin’ sloooow
Feelin’ lazy as hell
Just chillin’, same old same old
No cap, today’s a mess
Big mood rn
Kinda hungry, kinda lazy
This weather hittin’ different
I need a snack, like fr fr
Just here, existing
Energy level: -100
My brain left the chat
Straight up bored rn
This song on repeat, no regrets
Y’all ever just stare at a wall?
Midnight feels be hittin’
This hoodie stayin’ on all day
Sleep? Never heard of it
Just tryna survive out here
If laziness was a sport, I’d be champ
Bro, time don’t make sense no more
Running on vibes and vibes only
Too broke for this life
Can’t tell if I’m hungry or just bored
Life’s on autopilot rn
I got 99 problems and zero motivation
Could use a long ass nap
Mind empty, no thoughts
Just scrolling, don’t mind me
Procrastinating like a boss
Sleep schedule? Never had one
Just chillin’, per usual
Existential crisis, but make it aesthetic
Phone on 1%, just like my energy
Might just disappear for a bit
Lemme just vibe in peace
Hoodie szn forever
Being productive is a scam
My brain’s on airplane mode
A lil bit of chaos, a lil bit of vibes
Woke up, chose to do nothing
Not today, not ever
Who needs sleep when you got vibes
If overthinking was a job, I’d be CEO
Running purely on caffeine and bad decisions
Just out here tryna exist
Playlist on shuffle, life on pause
WiFi slow, life slow, everything slow
I do be vibin’ tho
My mood? Just… yeah
Too tired to function
The struggle is real, as always
Just another NPC moment
Ain’t tryna do too much today
My motivation dipped and never came back
I be living in my own world fr
Just one of them days
Been avoiding responsibilities all day
Stayin’ in my lane, mindin’ my business
If I had a dollar for every bad decision…
Barely surviving, but we out here
Sleep is for the weak, and I am weak
Just running on autopilot rn
Hoodie on, brain off
Ain’t no thoughts in this head rn
Literally just here for the vibes
My playlist carrying my entire existence
We out here being unproductive again
Another day, another dollar… or not
If laziness was a superpower, I’d be OP
Just chilling, letting life happen
Brain said “nah” today
If life had a pause button…
Mood: just existing
Ain’t got the energy for this
My life is just a long loading screen
Scrolling through life like it’s TikTok
Kinda awake, kinda dead inside
Just another day of doing the least
If overthinking burned calories, I’d be ripped
Just sittin’ here, mindin’ my own business
On that “whatever happens, happens” vibe
The floor and I are besties rn
Got zero plans, and that’s the plan
Hoodie + snacks = peak existence
Lowkey wanna sleep for 3 days
Just waiting for the weekend
Time ain’t real, bro
Might just lay here forever
Sleepy but not sleepy, y’know?
The WiFi got me questioning life
Just straight up existing rn
This couch got me in a chokehold
Vibing, surviving, barely thriving
Brain empty, just vibes
Just another chill ass day
If boredom was an Olympic sport…
Just another NPC moment, don’t mind me
